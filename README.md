<h2> About </h2>

Since release 1.7, Minecraft terrain generation has switched from generating more continent-like worlds with large oceans, to generating continuous land masses with overall smaller oceans. Earthbound is a [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra) configuration pack which aims to partially recreate the 1.6 style of world generation, as well as adding plenty of new, modern, refined biomes, as well as making the overall world more Earth-like, including things such as:

- Ice caps that generate past a certain vertical radius.
- Biome generation based on distance from equator and prime meridian.
- Large continents seperated by distinct oceans with occassional smaller islands.
